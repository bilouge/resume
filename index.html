                        <h2>My First Game</h2>
                        <p>
                            The creation of my first game was an introduction to Unity and programming with C#. Though extremely simplistic, it allowed me to 
                            understand the different components that go into creating a game. Everything seen in the game was made by myself.

                        <h2>Automatic Schedule Generator</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the prospect of a startup competition, I've worked on prototyping an automatic schedule generator. The purpose of this product would be to allow 
                            prospects in a database to be automatically assigned to time slots based on their attributes, e.g., whether they prefer working in the morning 
                            or the afternoon, whether they are English or Math professors, etc.<br>
                            After my idea has been selected, I was tasked with assembling a team and managing it for two days. My biggest takeaway from this project 
                            is that a human being can go 48 hours without sleep... Oh, and I also learned more project management methodologies.

                        <h2>Augmented Reality Social Media App</h2>
                        <p>
                            In the Spring of 2020, I signed up for a Hackathon where we decided to create an augmented reality app where users could leave "objects" for other 
                            users to see. The app also gave them the ability to place private objects that could only be viewed at specific locations. We also implemented other 
                            social-media-like functionalities such as the ability to leave likes and comments on public messages.<br>
                            This really allowed me to deepen my understanding of both Unity, by using it for other purposes than game development, and Blender which we used to create
                            the 3D objects that were placed on screen.
